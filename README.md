The Reading garden.

Reading in stream helps a small plant grow. You have to consistently to keep it growing. If you stop it wilts and is sad. 
Once the flowers grow up you can name them and place them in a garden.
If you don't read regularly they flowers in the garden die.
Later you can read for other 'things you can add to your garden'.
